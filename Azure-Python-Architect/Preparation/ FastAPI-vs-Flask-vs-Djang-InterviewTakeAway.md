Key Takeaways for Your Interview:
ðŸŽ¯ Quick Framework Elevator Pitch (memorize this):

FastAPI: "Modern, high-performance API framework with automatic documentation and native async support - perfect for microservices and cloud-native applications"
Flask: "Lightweight, flexible micro-framework - ideal for small services and when you need maximum control"
Django REST: "Enterprise-grade framework with batteries included - best for complex business applications requiring admin interfaces and comprehensive authentication"

Industry Reality Check:
For your specific role (Technical Architect with Azure/Python):

FastAPI is exploding in popularity for new projects
Django REST remains the enterprise standard
Flask is often used for specialized microservices

Most companies are moving from Flask â†’ FastAPI for new APIs, while keeping Django REST for complex web applications.

Quick Question Before We Continue:
Based on this comparison, which framework do you want to dive deep into first?
My recommendation: Start with FastAPI (60 minutes), then Django REST (45 minutes), then Flask (15 minutes for comparison).
